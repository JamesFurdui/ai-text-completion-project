# ai-text-completion-project

Setup:
There is little to set up in order to get the program up and running. 
The first is to import the 'cohere' library. You can first do that by running 'pip install cohere' then import cohere into your project.
The only other thing that is necessary is to add an API-Key for the cohere client. This will allow us to use cohere and it's text generation.

Usage:
To use the program, simply run the python script and explore all of the commands that are presented in the terminal during runtime. You can simply choose
to generate text which will allow the user to ask a question or insert a prompt for the AI to generate. Or the user can modify the pre-existing model by 
switching up the amount of tokens, the temperature, presence penalty, and the ability to enable/disable raw prompting. After the user has explored everything
and wants to quit the program, they can close the program in the main menu screen.
